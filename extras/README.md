# ProximityTester ver 3.8 (formerly known as "Tester")

(Note: This is not needed for normal use). A windowed application to thoroughly test the functionality of Quadtree.java, Quadnode.java and AABB.java. ProximityTester.java will create a number of AABBs with random values and continuously move them around the screen while updating the Quadtree and refreshing the screen. 
The simulator will allow you to:

- add/remove AABBs
- grow/shrink AABBs
- increase/decrease the tree depth
- increase/decrease the velocities of AABBs
- make the quadtree square or rectangular
- change the colors of Quadtree elements

## Since ver 3.16:
- "Dark" theme has been implemented as the standard UI look and feel
- some extra functionality has been added
- bug fixes and enhancements have been made (see CHANGE_LOG or "Issues" section)

## Usage:
1. place in the same directory as Quadtree.java, Quadnode.java and AABB.java
2. compile ProximityTester.java
3. run
