# ProximityTester.java
A windowed application to thoroughly test the functionality of Quadtree.java, Quadnode.java and AABB.java. ProximityTester.java will create 
a number of AABBs with random values and continuously move them around the screen while updating the quadtree and refreshing the screen. 
The simulator will allow you to:

- add/remove AABBs
- grow/shrink AABBs
- increase/decrease the tree depth
- increase/decrease the velocities of AABBs
- make the quadtree square or rectangular
- change the colors of Quadtree elements

## usage:
1. place in the same directory as Quadtree.java, Quadnode.java and AABB.java
2. compile ProximityTester.java
3. run
