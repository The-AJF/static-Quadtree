 Versioning
============

Version of Quadtree is done by simply adding the individual version of each Java class (except for
the examples) and dividing the total by the number of classes in the project (not counting the
examples).

 What has been changed since ver 3.16
======================================

- Quadtree can now compile and run under JDK 16.0.2.

- Added appropriate access level modifiers with setters and getters for better code encapsulation.

- Changed reference "Main.java" to "ProximityTester.java" in "About" Dialog.

- The Quadnode class was previously an inner class of Quadtree class. The Quadnode class has now
been extracted from Quadtree class and is now a stand-alone class.

- Tester.java has been renamed to "ProximityTester.java".

- ProximityTester.java now starts with a square Quadtree shape which is recommended for proper 
proximity test results. AABBs will have consistent proximity test results if the Quadtree shape
is square regardless of what direction the AABBs are with respect to each other. AABBs will be 
discovered to be in close proximity to each other more often when approaching each other on the
axis where Quadnode's have longer edges. This creates inconsistencies in proximity detection.

- Dark UI elements have been implemented for backgrounds, Buttons, etc.

- UI elements have been organized into labeled groups of JPanels with titles.

- Extra functionality has been added. The user is now able to remove more than just one AABB at a
time. It is possible to remove 5, 20 and 100 AABBs at once with an adjustment to the "remove_AABB"
method.

- Created overloaded grow_AABBs method with a parameter to accept an integer as an argument for
extra functionality. This method will grow (or shrink) AABBs by an integer value in both width and
height. This method will require some extra work since increasing the width and height of AABBs
by a constant will cause the proportions to change. See "Issues" in Quadtree Repository.

- Changed floating point values to double-precision floating point values (float to double) in most
instances where they were found.

- Tree depth increase no longer causes ProximityTester to crash. Pausing the simulation before
increasing the tree depth and then un-pausing appears to have remedied this.

- removing all but the last AABB no longer causes all AABBs to be removed (in-between ver 3.16 and
3.27).

- Added the ability to change the Colors of everything that makes up the Quadtree including AABBs.
